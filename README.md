# who is iampixelbot?
Hey, my fake name is Pixelbot. 
I am commited to online privacy. Privacy is a right, and privacy should be existent online. What if someone were to listen on you while having a private conversation? Yeah that would suck. Which is why I think that online privacy is a right, not a privilege. And it's important to be more aware of online privacy.

I own Blumemail as a result, and I am the original founder & CEO.
I try to help out my team with some of the code (sometimes I am not really good at it) and try to create a safe and good work environment virtually.

I primarily do graphic design for Blumemail when I am bored. And I also take support tickets when I am bored too so most likely you will see me in some tickets!

But outside of Blumemail I like to add some humor to some things that I say, I like to talk to friends and better yet I like designing stuff for Blumemail (again) sometimes editing for Blumemail (i am the worst editor)

Hope you liked my introduction!
